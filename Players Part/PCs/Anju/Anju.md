My character is Anju, the oldest daughter of 5 siblings. Anju's father always wanted a son but he
was only blessed with daughters. Believing only males could lead the great southern water tribe
to further prosperity, he decided to raise Anju like the son he always wanted to have.
(Anju is derived from "Angijua" in Inuktitut which means "older brother")
The mother died after giving birth to the 5th child, Anju and her siblings were raised by their
father and the father's sister.

Even though Anju was raised like a man, she has a feminine side to her which she learned from
her aunt. The father is strict but also a good instructor. In time, Anju has enough athletic ability
to pass as an average male of her tribe (though not outstanding like Korra). Anju's strength lies
in her ability to create icicles. One of her greatest achievements - and also secrets - is when she
created thick icicle soles to appear ~5cm taller, which made her taller than her father at that time
and caused her father to appear proud of her for the first time in forever.

Seeing Anju's proficient icicle making, her father is convinced she is a very talented bender, maybe
even with potential of becoming the next Avatar. He sends Anju off to
<ENTER SUMMSI'S NAME FOR THE AVATAR CAMP HERE> with one request to
Anju: "Be a great man that makes the southern water tribe proud"
