| **Stat**               | **Value**   |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |

| **Dexterity (DEX)**    | **16 (+3)** |
| **Constitution (CON)** | **10 (+0)** |

- **Size:** Small
    
- **Ideal for infiltration, distraction, and sensory manipulation.** Luma’tik thrives in urban or crystal-laced environments, using its shimmering form and illusions to mislead enemies and aid allies from the shadows. Though not powerful in direct combat, it’s difficult to pin down and annoying to deal with.

### **Abilities in Luma’tik Form:**

- **Refraction Veil:** While in bright or shifting light, Luma’tik gains advantage on Stealth and cannot be targeted by opportunity attacks. This effect ends if Luma’tik is in total darkness or complete silence.
    
- **Mirage Flicker (1/rest):** As a bonus action, Luma’tik can create up to two illusionary duplicates for 1 minute. Each duplicate mimics its movements and grants attackers disadvantage on attack rolls until they hit Luma’tik.
    
- **Pulse of Dazzling Light (1/rest):** Emit a flash in a 10 m radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC (8 + [[Dex]] + [[Proficiency]]) Constitution saving throw or be **blinded** until the end of their next turn. Allies who avert their gaze are unaffected.
    
- **Glimmerjump:** Once per short rest, teleport to any point within 20 m that is brightly lit or reflects light (e.g., mirrors, water, crystal surfaces). Leaves behind a fading afterimage for 1 round that enemies may target by mistake.

_Luma’tik is a playful, capricious entity—often found dancing between fractured crystal surfaces or taunting intruders with flickers of light and laughter. Bonding with this spirit gives a bender or spiritualist access to stealth, misdirection, and flash-based utility, ideal for scouts or cunning tacticians._

Let me know if you'd like a version statted for NPC encounters instead of transformation, or if you want to place this in the world (e.g., where Luma’tik haunts or manifests).
