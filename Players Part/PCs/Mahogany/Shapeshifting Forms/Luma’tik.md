Though not powerful in direct combat, it’s difficult to pin down and annoying to deal with.

### **Abilities in Luma’tik Form:**

- **Refraction Veil:** While in bright or shifting light, Luma’tik gains advantage on Stealth and cannot be targeted by opportunity attacks. This effect ends if Luma’tik is in total darkness or complete silence.
    
- **Mirage Flicker (1/[[Short Rest]]):** As a bonus action, Luma’tik can create up to two illusionary duplicates for 1 minute. Each duplicate mimics its movements and grants attackers disadvantage on attack rolls until they hit Luma’tik.
    
- **Pulse of Dazzling Light (3/rest):** Emit a flash in a 10 m radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC (8 + [[Wisdom]] + [[Proficiency]]) Constitution saving throw or be **blinded** until the end of their next turn. Allies who avert their gaze are unaffected.
    
- **Glimmerjump:** 
- Reaction:
	teleport to any point within 20 m that is brightly lit or reflects light (e.g., mirrors, water, crystal surfaces)

_Luma’tik is a playful, capricious entity—often found dancing between fractured crystal surfaces or taunting intruders with flickers of light and laughter. Bonding with this spirit gives a bender or spiritualist access to stealth, misdirection, and flash-based utility, ideal for scouts or cunning tacticians._
