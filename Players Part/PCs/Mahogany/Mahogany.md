Air Spirit

*Backstory*:  
Once a small spirit living among the Air Nomads, I helped them forage, offering guidance and protection in their peaceful, nature-centered life. But when the spirit doors closed, I was trapped in the Spirit World, separated from the humans I cared for.

After countless years, I found a way to cross back through an abandoned Air Nomad temple. When I arrived, I was shocked to see how much the world had changed—machines, bending powers, and humans who no longer lived in harmony with nature.

Confused and fascinated, I wander this unfamiliar world, trying to understand what has happened and how I can help again.
