#### Leadership:

1. **[[Isay Trekal]] (she/her) (Faction Leader)**
    
    - **Physical Description:**  
        A striking woman in her early forties with jet-black hair styled into an intricate braid that cascades down her back. Her pale blue eyes seem to pierce through her opponents, reflecting a sharp intellect and unshakable resolve. Her high cheekbones and angular features give her an almost regal appearance. She wears an ornate, high-collared cloak adorned with faintly glowing charms.
    - **Bending Style:**  
        Waterbending focused on offensive techniques, including the manipulation of black mist—a mixture of water vapor and fine particles, creating disorienting smoke.
    - **Role:**  
        Charismatic leader and visionary behind the rebellion. Isay is a master tactician and inspiring orator.
2. **[[Jin Koga]](she/her) (Second-in-Command)**
    
    - **Physical Description:**  
        A sturdy woman with sun-kissed skin and short, spiky hair the color of sandy blonde. She has a confident, swaggering gait, often adorned with sand-crusted boots and bracers. Her lightweight armor is covered with fine grains of sand that move subtly as she walks.
    - **Bending Style:**  
        Earthbending with a specialization in sand manipulation.
    - **Role:**  
        Oversees the Night Bloom’s military operations, crafting strategies for their attacks.
3. **[[Rin Xolai]](he/him) (Spiritualist)**
    
    - **Physical Description:**  
        A tall, gaunt man with alabaster skin and wispy, shoulder-length white hair that seems to shift like mist in the wind. His gray eyes are perpetually half-lidded, giving him a detached, eerie demeanor. His flowing black robes ripple unnaturally, as if caught in a constant breeze. His soft-spoken voice carries an unsettling intensity.
    - **Bending Style:**  
        Airbending with a dark twist—manipulating sound waves to confuse and disorient enemies and bending the air around him to make him almost invisible.
    - **Role:**  
        Spirit guide of the Night Bloom, responsible for forging alliances with rogue spirits.
