**Joining Moves:**  
Benders can combine their abilities to create more powerful or creative effects, guided by the "rule of cool." This allows for dynamic and collaborative gameplay that rewards teamwork.

---

**Conditions to Join:**

- **Proximity:** You must be within 10 feet of the ally initiating the Move.
- **Action Type:** Joining the Move requires using your reaction.
- **Move Compatibility:** The same Move does not need to be performed at the same Level Slot as the initiating Bender.

---

**Effect:**  
Combining Moves enhances their overall power or effect. For example, if an ally uses [[Fireburst]], and you join in, the resulting effect could be strong enough to burst through a stone wall.

**Optional Variant:**  
You can also combine different Moves if you can explain how they interact. For instance:

- A **Mud Wall** created by an Earthbender could be reinforced with an **Ice Wall** from a Waterbender, resulting in a sturdier barrier with sharp ice spike defenses.  
    This opens opportunities for creative problem-solving and innovative combinations, adding depth to gameplay.
