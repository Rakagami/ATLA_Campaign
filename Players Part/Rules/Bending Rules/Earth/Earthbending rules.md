#### **Overview:**

Earthbenders are solid and steadfast, drawing upon the Strength of their bodies and the stability of the ground beneath them. Their techniques focus on defense, fortification, and manipulating terrain. Rather than relying on agility to avoid blows, earthbenders create barriers, raise armor ratings, and reinforce their allies. They harness **Earth Charges** to shape stone and metal, providing a constant, reliable source of defense and stability.

### **Core Mechanics:**

#### **1. Earth Charges:**

- **What Are Earth Charges?**  
    Earth Charges represent the raw earthen materials and energy an earthbender can manipulate at any given time. They are used to fuel bending abilities.
    
#### **2. Strength-Based Bending:**

- **Attack and Damage:**  
    When making attack rolls with earthbending abilities, use Strength + Proficiency vs. Evasion Score.
    
- **Defensive Focus:**  
    Many earthbending abilities enhance Armor Rating (AR) or create barriers and constructs that raise AR for the earthbender and their allies.

---

#### **3. Armor and Barriers:**

- **Raising AR:**  
    Earthbenders can mold stone armor, erect walls, or craft protective shells that increase the Armor Rating of themselves or allies.
- **Construct Durability:**  
    Constructs and armor created by earthbending have their own Hit Points and can be shattered by heavy attacks, reducing the Earth Charges invested.

---

#### **4. Skill Checks for Advanced Manipulation:**

- **Material Quality:**  
    Shaping tough materials like metal may require higher DCs, while simple soil or loose rock is easier to manipulate.
- **Complex Shapes:**  
    Creating detailed structures (bridges, stairs, sculptures) might require skill checks and possibly multiple Actions or more Earth Charges.

---

### **Sample Low-Level Abilities:**

1. [[Earthen Shield]] (1 Charge) - A quick defensive plate of stone.
2. [[Stonefist Strike]] (2 Charges) - A melee-range burst of stone from the ground.
3. [[Rock Armor]] (2 Charges) - Reinforce yourself or an ally’s armor rating.
4. [[Stone Spike]] (1 Charge) - A simple offensive spike of earth.

(These would have their own pages similar to the waterbending examples.)

### **File: Stonefist Strike (Low-Level Ability)**

- **Cost:** 2 Earth Charges
- **Type:** Action
- **Range:** Melee (5 ft)
- **Effect:**  
    The earthbender slams their fist down, causing a stone spike or fist-shaped pillar to erupt upward at an adjacent enemy.
    - **Attack Roll:** Strength + Proficiency vs. Evasion Score
    - **Damage:** 1d8 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage
    - On a critical hit, the target must make a Strength save (DC = 8 + Proficiency + Strength mod) or be knocked prone.

---

### **Scaling and Progression:**

- **Higher-Level Abilities:**  
    As the earthbender advances in level, they gain access to stronger constructions like [[Wall of Stone]], [[Earth Ramparts]], or [[Full Stone Plate]], each providing greater AR boosts or covering larger areas.  
    Offensive abilities scale to deal more damage or affect multiple enemies.
- **Material Mastery:**  
    At higher tiers, earthbenders can manipulate metal, gemstone-like minerals, or volcanic rock for specialized effects, like granting resistance to certain damage types or creating powerful fortified structures that grant cover and AR boosts to multiple allies.

By focusing on Strength, defense, and environment-based fortifications, this earthbending ruleset emphasizes the solid, reliable nature of earth as both armor and weapon. Players can tailor their playstyle towards personal defense, party support, or battlefield control through sturdy constructs and strategic terrain manipulation.
