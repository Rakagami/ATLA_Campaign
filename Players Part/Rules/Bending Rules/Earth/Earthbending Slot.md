### Explanation:

1. **Slots Increase Each Level**: As characters level up, they gain slots to learn new moves, and the distribution of slots ensures steady growth and access to higher-level moves.
2. **Balanced Progression**: Players gain slots evenly while progressively unlocking new levels at **Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17**.
