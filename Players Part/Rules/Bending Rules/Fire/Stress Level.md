- **Stress Level**: Firebenders gain a stress level counter, starting at 0. Stress increases by 1 each time the firebender is hit by an attack. For every [[Stress Level]] the Firebender suffers -1 to attack Rolls but +1 to any damage. At high levels, stress can be managed or turned into a weapon. At the End of each of your Turn you **can** roll a [[Wisdom]] DC 20 - [[Stress Level]]. If successful the Stresslevel goes Down by 1.
