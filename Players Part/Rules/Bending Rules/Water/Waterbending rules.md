#### **Overview:**

Waterbenders are versatile combatants who manipulate water, ice, and mist with fluid, adaptive techniques. Unlike other benders, they rely on a resource called **Water Charges** to perform bending abilities. Their style focuses on redirection, control, and adaptability, drawing power from their environment.

### **Core Mechanics:**

**1. Redirection Mechanic:**

Waterbenders excel at using their enemiesâ€™ attacks against them. This mechanic reflects their unique style.

As a reaction when hit by ranged physical attack.
- **Counter-Redirect physical:**
    - Cost: 1 Water Charge per 1d10 Damage redirected.
    - When targeted by a ranged physical attack, the Waterbender can redirect it back to the attacker or a different target. This attack has the same range as the initial attack. If you reduce the damage you take to 0 you get back all used Watercharges.
    - Redirected attacks deal half damage.

As a reaction when hit by a physical melee attack
- **Parry:**
    - Cost: 1 Water Charge per 1d6 Damage parried.
    - Reduce incoming physical melee damage by 1d6 + Dexterity modifier.
    
As a reaction when hit by a Waterbending Attack
-**Counter Waterbending**
    - Cost: None.
    - When targeted by a Waterbending attack, you can use their own Waterbending to reduce the Damage by 1d10 per Character Level.
    - If the Damage is reduced to 0 you can use one of your own Waterbending attacks with the same (or less) Watercharges cost.

Mud bending costs more charges as it is harder to bend than pure water. (*1.5)
