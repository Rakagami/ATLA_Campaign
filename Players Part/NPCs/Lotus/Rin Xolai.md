he/him
**Physical Description:**  
        A tall, gaunt man with alabaster skin and wispy, shoulder-length white hair that seems to shift like mist in the wind. His gray eyes are perpetually half-lidded, giving him a detached, eerie demeanor. His flowing black robes ripple unnaturally, as if caught in a constant breeze. His soft-spoken voice carries an unsettling intensity.
    - **Bending Style:**  
        Airbending with a dark twistâ€”manipulating sound waves to confuse and disorient enemies and bending the air around him to make him almost invisible.
